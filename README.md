#### Model 1.0 Features

- It has the capacity to do the following using Python3 and OpenCV:

1. Detects traffic lights and identifies the light status.
2. Detects lanes on the road.
3. Detects pedestrians.
4. Detects stop signs.
5. Detects vehicles.

#### Future features for Model 1.1

- By using OpenCV, TensorFlow and Python3 can do the following:

1. Detect traffic lights, lanes on the road, pedestrians, stop signs and vehicles.
2. Send objects it cannot detect to developers
3. earn using data during testing.

#### Future features for Model 1.2

- By using OpenCV, TensorFlow and Python3 can do the following:

1. Detects all components of traffic (signs, vehicles, markings, pedestrians).
2. Understand the behavior of the components (vehicle turning right, pedestrian crossing)
3. Detects situations it cannot detect, collects data and sends it to developers.
